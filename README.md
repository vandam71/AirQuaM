# AirQuaM
  As humanity progress with the Industry 4.0 revolution, there’s a total need to
control even more the pollution and the air quality over the cities and residential areas.
The major countries are trying at all cost to reduce the amount of polluted air and
particles in certain places to avoid considerable health issues.  
  Our goal is to develop a lightweight platform capable of analyzing the air quality,
sending the information to a database and predicting evolution according to past data
pickups. It’ll also have a feature to render in real-time, as a user or a researcher travels
around an area, a map with the values of chemicals in that zone.  
  The hole product would be a two part element, one side that would be sensor
central, where all the data collection is made, and then there would be a server side ap-
plication, where the main focus would be all the data processing, user settings definitions
and the AI predicting patters.  
  This would be a multi-job product since it could be doing the field research process,
with a team moving it around picking data from various locations in order to render a
map, or a stand-by process, where it would be assembled in a fixed spot doing regular
collects to also evaluate the gas presence and quantities during the time, latter to be
analyzed by the AI to predict said evolution patters.
